# wikipedia-search

Search a random selection of Wikipedia articles.

On launch the app will fetch a number of random articles from the
Wikipedia API, store them in the Postgres DB instance, and then index them in an inverted index.
You can then search for terms and the app will return the relevant article titles from those fetched, as ranked by a
[BM25 ranking algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25).

## Development
### Install pre-commit hooks
This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run automated checks on code before it is committed. To
install pre-commit hooks, follow these steps:

1. Install pre-commit: `pip install pre-commit`
2. Install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`
3. Run pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit run -a`


## Running the app
### Docker (recommended)
In the root directory of the project, run:
```docker-compose up --build```

### Locally
Requires Python3.9+. Package requirements can be found in `requirements/local.txt`.

Activate your virtual environment of choice and then install the dependencies using:
```pip install -Ur requirements/local.txt```

Once requirements are installed, navigate to the `src` folder and run:

`uvicorn main:app --reload`

The Docker or the local instructions will launch the application on port 8000 by default.

Example search (you may need to change the query to see some results, since you will receive a different set of random
articles):
[http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/?q=act](http://127.0.0.1:8000/search?query=act)

Example result:
```json
{
    "results":
         {
            "Statue of Cosimo I": 1.6436972762369082,
